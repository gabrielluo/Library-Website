Hello, welcome to SWC Web Design Club: 
	This is a place where you are encouraged to use your abilities in web design, development and maintenance. 

<strong>[Mission]</strong>
to make things clear, this club has basically two functions: 

		Design Group
				We make websites for our school and people in need. We call every site that we are going to build a "project". Our first and current project is a new "Churchill Library Website". You can click on the following link to see what it looks like now: 
<code>http://go.vsb.bc.ca/schools/churchill/Library/Pages/default.aspx</code>
				For more information about this project, please read the next email. 
				
		Forum 
				It is very important for us to discuss our projects. We need to work as a group so let's make sure that we have a same goal before set our foot. If you are a beginner, feel free to ask and inquire--as long as you are polite. If you believe that you are able to answer others' questions, please spend some time on helping each other. Remember how curious you once were.

<strong>[Structure]</strong>
web designing is not difficult but rather complex. To make every one happy on what they are doing, we divide our club into three departments: 

		Art Department
				You artist may think what counts most for a good website is its layout--that is why you are important. We love you and your art work, but notice that web arts concerns not only aesthetic taste but also user convenience. Befriend those in 'Planning Department' because you may communicate quite often.

		Development Department
				If you have read this line, congratulations on being a member of Dev. Department because no one except you geeks would want to know anything after word "development". Coding is time consuming but we do enjoy it(if not, pretend so). We are doing the 'root' jobs that no one can even read a word in our masterpiece. (Hope your code is clear and decent though, we don't want to cause trouble in maintenance.) 

		Planning Department
				If we say that the former two departments gives life to our website, you are the ones who assign spirit to it. Who are using our website? What function do they anticipate? Is this design user-friendly? In this department, you need to see clearly, think deeply and talk effectively. You are participating on the user's behalf so we respect your idea.

<strong>[Benefits]</strong>
when we are doing school projects, everyone earns Volunteer Hours depending on the work you provided. As some of you may be new to Churchill, this is related to grad. prep. so it's always a good idea to do it early. I didn't declare that on the Club's Day because I want to attract people who are really enthusiastic about our club. So take it as a surprise. In order to earn that, don't forget to record what you did and tell me so that I can report it to Ms.Wilson. Of course, spending 5 hours on 10 lines of code or 3 strokes is not that cogent. Be frank and be cool. (If you are a beginner so it did take that much time, tell me and I will evaluate that.)

<strong>[Meetings]</strong>
The first meeting will be at As a club dealing with internet, we need to utilize this resource well. We can communicate in Facebook Group, as shown below: 
*LINK*
(do you like to have a forum site just belongs to us? It can be like a play-ground where we can try out new stuff. If so, tell me.)

We will hold group meeting to discuss issues face to face in the library. After the library renovation is finished, we can meet regularly. Stay tuned. 


	Finally, please reply this email so I can verify your address is not misspelled. In the letter, include what department you are interested in. Briefly state why you are happy to be there (your experiences, skills etc.). If you just want to try being there, don't be shy, we will see how it goes. 

Stay CHILL and make CHILL webs, cheers! 

President,
Gabriel Luo
