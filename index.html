<p><strong>What are the characteristics of Git?</strong></p>

<p>It's simply <strong>COOL</strong>.</p>

<p>If you have used Microsoft Word before, you must have this experience:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>You wanted to delete a paragraph, but being afaird of losing it permanently. So you used "save as ......" and created a new Word document, and then went on changing more, you need to "save as ......" another  file... Ultimately your folder became this:</em></p>

<p>A week later, you wanted to retrieve a block of deleted text, but could not remember which files was the desired one, then you needed to take a deep search into every files, which is really troublesome.</p>

<p>To make matter worse, when you needed help from your colleague, you copied the file to a USB driver to her (or email or something), and continued to modify that .doc files. One day later, your colleague send back her file to you, at this time, you have to think about what changes have her made and what is your parts that ought to be preserved.</p>

<p>If there is a software that can help you to record changes automatically each time anyone edit the file, you can let colleagues edit a same file collaboratively, without messing it up when passing it around. If you want to see a particular change you can do it with a simple glance, <strong>isn't that super convenient?</strong>
This record turns out to be:</p>

<p>By this time, you quit manage multiple "versions" manually and started a brave world of <em><strong>version control</strong>.</em></p>
